<A NAME="PHI_CD_ROM_Format"></A>
<H1>PHI CD ROM Format</H1>

<p>The recent CD ROMs issued by the TLG and PHI follow the
ISO 9660:1988 (E) standard for volume and directory structure.
Please note, however, that the internal organization of the
riles does not conform to the optional &quot;variable length
record&quot; structure defined in that standard.</p>

<p>You may be able to use a standard software driver to
locate the files in the directory and read the file data from
the CD ROM: but your program will need to read the file in
binary mode and extract the text records from the blocks
according to the format information presented in this
document.</p>

<p>Most files on the CD ROM are either text files or ID
Table files.</p>

<p>Each text file (designated by the filename extension
.TXT) consists of variable-length text records delimited by
compressed binary-coded ID citations. The binary ID format is
described <A HREF="#ID_Data">below on page 5</A>; in summary, each byte of id information has the high-order bit set. The text itself is in 7-bit
ASCII coded according to the conventions described in the
document &quot;Beta Coding summary.&quot;</p>

<p>Each ID Table file (designated by the filename extension
.IDT) is a table of contents to the corresponding text file
designed to facilitate rapid access to particular sections of
the text. The ID Table file has a complex structure and come
applications may choose not to make any use of it. A text file
is fully usable without any reference to its ID Table file.
Each ID Table file is guaranteed to be allocated immediately
before its associated .TXT file to facilitate accessing these
files by reading consecutive sectors.</p>

<p>The Author List (with the filename AUTHTAB.DIR) contains
descriptive information for each text file on the disc. The
purpose of the Author Table is to allow the user to ask for
the author Plato, for example, without having to know that the
actual file name is TLG0059. Each entry contains the author
name, the corresponding file name synonyms, remarks, and
language. The entries are arranged by category.</p>

<P>[page 4]</P>

<A NAME="Text_Files"></A>
<H2>Text Files</H2>

<p>A text file usually contains the writings (encoded as necessary) of one or more ancient authors. These all carry a traditional citation system. There are other kinds of text files, though: which may contain (e.g.) bibliographic data or morphologically analyzed text. For consistency, these texts also carry a citation system (usually a simple line increment).</p>

<p>Text files are organized in blocks of 8192 bytes. Each block begins with the full citation for the first record of the block. Subsequent records are preceded by an abbreviated citation. since the ID bytes are all marked with the sign bit set, the citation serves to separate the variable length text records from one another. The end of block is signalled by an end of block marker in an ID field following the last record of the block. End of file is indicated by a marker preceding the end of block marker for the final block. Records do not span blocks.</p>

<p>Processing a block of text is therefore simple. Read in all bytes with the sign bit set. This is the ID or the first record. Call a subroutine to decode the ID data. Now read in all bytes with the sign bit unset. This is the text of the first record. call a subroutine to process the text. Repeat this process for all records in the block, that is, until the ID data contains the end of block marker.</p>

<p>For a description of the text format for Greek texts see
the document &quot;Beta Coding Summary.&quot;<p>

<P>[page 5]</P>

<A NAME="ID_Data"></A>
<H2>ID Data</H2>
<P>The format of the ID data is the same for text (.TXT) and
ID (.IDT) files. A single subroutine can therefore be written
to decode the ID information from both file types. The data
includes both strictly citational information and unstructured
descriptive material; the two are independent of each other
and since the descriptive information (where it exists) always
follows the citation information it may easily be disregarded
by a simplified decoding subroutine. Included in the data are
codes specifying the ID level (for citations, <SPAN CLASS="idlevel">a..d</SPAN>,<SPAN CLASS="idlevel">n</SPAN>,<SPAN CLASS="idlevel">v..z</SPAN>; for
descriptors, <SPAN CLASS="idlevel">a..z</SPAN>) and the ID value. In addition: certain
control codes (end-of-block, end-of-file) are included among
the ID bytes.</P>

<A NAME="Citation_data"></A>
<H3>Citation data</H3>

<P>The ID levels <SPAN CLASS="idlevel">a</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="idlevel">b</SPAN> are reserved for the citation of
the author and work respectively. These levels occur in every
text. The <SPAN CLASS="idlevel">c</SPAN> level is an optional level specifying the preferred 
abbreviation for a work (this is used where, as at the TLG
and PHI, the work is cited by a control number). The <SPAN CLASS="idlevel">d</SPAN> level
also is optional and specifies the preferred abbreviation for
an author (for example, at PHI, &quot;Verg&quot; is the <SPAN CLASS="idlevel">d</SPAN> level for
Vergil). As an example, Vergil's <U>Aeneid</U> will have citations at
the <SPAN CLASS="idlevel">a</SPAN> through <SPAN CLASS="idlevel">d</SPAN> levels of <SPAN CLASS="idlevel">a</SPAN> = &quot;0690&quot;, <SPAN CLASS="idlevel">b</SPAN> = &quot;003&quot;, <SPAN CLASS="idlevel">c</SPAN> = &quot;A&quot; and
<SPAN CLASS="idlevel">d</SPAN> = &quot;Verg&quot;. The optional <SPAN CLASS="idlevel">c</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="idlevel">d</SPAN> levels are not included in
the ID Table files. since each work is fully identified by the
<SPAN CLASS="idlevel">a</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="idlevel">b</SPAN> levels.</P>

<P>The lower levels, <SPAN CLASS="idlevel">n</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="idlevel">v</SPAN> through <SPAN CLASS="idlevel">z</SPAN>, are used to cite
fields within an individual work. For a given work these
behave according to one of two schemes. In the first (this is
the only scheme used by the TLG and PHI prior to 1990), the <SPAN CLASS="idlevel">n</SPAN>
level is not used and levels <SPAN CLASS="idlevel">v</SPAN> through <SPAN CLASS="idlevel">z</SPAN> are used hierarchically: 
the field varying most rapidly is always <SPAN CLASS="idlevel">z</SPAN> and denotes
the line number; the other levels are used only as needed.
Thus in the New Testament the <SPAN CLASS="idlevel">x</SPAN> level is the chapter, the <SPAN CLASS="idlevel">y</SPAN>
level is the verse, and the <SPAN CLASS="idlevel">z</SPAN> level is the line. The number of
levels within a work is constant. This type of citation is
typically used for literary texts.</P>

<P>In the second scheme, the <SPAN CLASS="idlevel">n</SPAN> level is always present (its
presence or absence alone indicates which scheme is in effect)
and is used to specify a &quot;document&quot; within a work. Levels <SPAN CLASS="idlevel">v</SPAN>
through <SPAN CLASS="idlevel">z</SPAN>, in this scheme, are subordinate to <SPAN CLASS="idlevel">n</SPAN> (that is, when
n changes <SPAN CLASS="idlevel">v</SPAN> through <SPAN CLASS="idlevel">z</SPAN> become null) but they are not otherwise
arranged hierarchically: they change independently of one
another. The <SPAN CLASS="idlevel">z</SPAN> level is reserved for line number but the other
levels, <SPAN CLASS="idlevel">v</SPAN> through <SPAN CLASS="idlevel">y</SPAN> are assigned to whatever fields are
appropriate to the document at hand. This type of citation
allows for handling the individual inscriptions or papyri
within a single volume (work), each of which may have varying
numbers of ID levels for information such as fragments, sides
and columns.
</P>

<P>[page 6]</P>

<A NAME="Descriptive_data"></A>
<H3>Descriptive data</H3>

<P>The optional descriptor ID levels (<SPAN CLASS="idlevel">a..z</SPAN>) are used
independently of levels <SPAN CLASS="idlevel">a..d</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="idlevel">n</SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="idlevel">v..z</SPAN> to hold comments or
descriptive information. They are not part of the citation
scheme and are not themselves hierarchical. The comment
contained in a descriptor ID level applies to all the text
lines that follow until the value of that descriptor level
changes or a change in the work or document level sets all the
descriptor levels to null. Their assignment (level <SPAN CLASS="idlevel">l</SPAN>, for
example, to indicate the location of a papyrus, or <SPAN CLASS="idlevel">d</SPAN> to
indicate its date) is determined by the data preparer.
Although there are twenty-six possible descriptor ID levels
(<SPAN CLASS="idlevel">a..z</SPAN>), PHI has used no more than eight in a single document.
PHI reserves the <SPAN CLASS="idlevel">z</SPAN> descriptor level as a comment sequence
number within a work: in the display of continuous text (with
optimized ID's), it facilitates determining where the data
preparer intended a comment to appear but has no other
conventional meaning and is not part of the original comment.
These descriptors are not included in ID Table files.</P>

<A NAME="ID_values"></A>
<H3>ID values</H3>

<P>ID values are divided into binary and ASCII components.
Leading digits: if any: are converted into a binary value) any
trailing characters become the ASCII component. Thus, the
citation &quot;12&quot; has a binary value of 12 and no ASCII value. The
citation &quot;l2a&quot; also has a binary value of 12 but an ASCII
value of &quot;a&quot;. The citation &quot;a12&quot; has no binary value and and
ASCII value of &quot;al2&quot;.</P>

<P>The ASCII component presently can have a total length
from 1 to 15 characters (citations) or l to 31 characters
(descriptors) as used on the CD ROMs being described; these
values may change in future releases.</P>

<A NAME="id_comparison"></A>
<P>When citations are compared, the binary value is compared
first. If the binary values match, the ASCII values are
converted to lower case and compared character by character,
but runs of digits within the ASCII string are evaluated as
numbers. Thus the citation &quot;3a&quot; is less than the citation
&quot;l2a&quot; (since binary 3 is less than binary 12) and citation
&quot;a3&quot; is less than the citation &quot;a12&quot; (even though ASCII 3 is
greater than ASCII 1): &quot;3B&quot; is greater than &quot;3a&quot; and &quot;t&quot; is
less than &quot;1&quot; By the same rules, &quot;A3l&quot; is less than both
&quot;A3OO&quot; and &quot;AB&quot; since 31 comes before 300 (numeric) and &quot;A&quot;
comes before &quot;AB&quot; (string).</P>

<P>Numbers can range from 1 to 16383; larger numbers are
treated (and sorted) as strings. .</P>

<P>An ID level is explicitly set to null if it consists of
a null string, coded with no binary value followed by a string
of length zero.</P>

<P>[page 7]</P>

<A NAME="Decoding"></A>
<H3>Decoding</H3>
<P>An ID byte may be distinguished from a text byte by the
high bit (the sign bit) of the byte. Since the text encoding
system is based on 7-bit ASCII characters, the sign bit is
always clear for text bytes; the sign bit is always set for ID
bytes. This distinction makes it easy to separate ID
information from text information as the data is processed.</P>

<P>The first byte of an ID sequence is always a code byte.
The code byte is followed by data bytes, as required.
Additional code bytes vith their data bytes may follow.
Descriptor code and value bytes, where they exist, always
follow citation bytes.</P>

<P>In order to process a code byte the left and right hand
nibbles must be isolated. The left nibble will usually contain
the level code and the right nibble will contain information
about the ID value for that level. When processing any attendant 
data bytes, the sign bit must first be stripped. For
ASCII datae one need only clear the sign bit. For binary data,
though it ia necessary to consider the value exclusive of the
sign bit. Thus a two-byte binary value contains only 14 bits
of information (the lowest seven bits of each byte).</P>

<A NAME="Left_nibble"></A>
<H4>Left nibble</H4>
<P>Since the sign bit is always set, there are eight
possible values for the left nibble.</P>

<A NAME="Escape_codes"></A>
<H4>Escape codes</H4>

<P>When the left nibble is binary ll10, the right nibble
contains information on the ID value, as above. The level code
is, however, contained in the next byte. This level code
occupies the full byte (disregarding the sign bit) and should
be processed immediately, as it will intervene between the
right nibble code and any data bytes which follow.</P>

<P>The values defined by the escape code usually describe
high level citation ID fields (ie, author, work) or descriptor
ID's. The level code contained in the next byte has for
citation ID's the possible values: <SPAN CLASS="idlevel">a</SPAN>=0, <SPAN CLASS="idlevel">b</SPAN>=1, <SPAN CLASS="idlevel">c</SPAN>=2, and <SPAN CLASS="d">d</SPAN>=4; for
descriptor ID's: <SPAN CLASS="idlevel">a</SPAN>=97, <SPAN CLASS="idlevel">b</SPAN>=98, <SPAN CLASS="idlevel">c</SPAN>=99, ... , <SPAN CLASS="idlevel">z</SPAN>=l22 . Descriptor
ID's thus always begin with an escape code (left nibble is
binary 1110) and always have a level code (sign bit
disregarded) greater than 96.</P>

<A NAME="Special_codes"></A>
<H4>Special codes</H4>

and null padding.</P>

<P>Exception-start and exception-ènd are included optionally
to delimit text lines that appear out-of-order (when evaluated
by the <A HREF="#id_comparison">comparison technique described above</A>). These codes are
never needed to determine the current ID and may be ignored;
they are intended only to serve as hints in browsing through a
text rearranged from its traditional order by a modern editor.
Abbreviated ID Fields</P>

<P>In ID files, the full ID is given for each author ID
(level <SPAN CLASS="idlevel">a</SPAN> only), each work ID (level <SPAN CLASS="idlevel">b</SPAN> only) and each new
section (levels <SPAN CLASS="idlevel">n</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="idlevel">v-z</SPAN>); descriptor ID levels are not
included in ID files. In text vilest the full ID (a11 levels:
citation and descriptor) is given at the beginning of each 8K
block. Other ID fields usually contain only enough information
to show how the current ID field differs from the last. Thus,

[page 9]

most lines in a text require only the code for &quot;increment the z level&quot; (binary 1000 0000). When the higher levels do not change, they need not be cited. When a higher level does change and levels <SPAN CLASS="idlevel">v</SPAN> through <SPAN CLASS="idlevel">z</SPAN> are hierarchical (that is, no <SPAN CLASS="idlevel">n</SPAN> level is present), all lower levels are implicitly set to binary 1. This often obviates the need to cite the lower levels explicitly. Thus, to mark line 1 of Chapter 2 in a (hierarchical) work, the required citation would be &quot;increment the <SPAN CLASS="idlevel">y</SPAN> level&quot; (binary 1001 0000) since the <SPAN CLASS="idlevel">y</SPAN> level was previously set for Chapter 1 and the <SPAN CLASS="idlevel">z</SPAN> level is set to 1 implicitly. Note that when the author or work changes, all lower levels are set to null.</P>

<P>When levels <SPAN CLASS="idlevel">v</SPAN> through <SPAN CLASS="idlevel">z</SPAN> are not hierarchical (that is, in
documents, where the <SPAN CLASS="idlevel">n</SPAN> level is present), a change in author,
work or document <SPAN CLASS="idlevel">n</SPAN>-level) sets all lower levels to null.
Otherwise the lower levels are set explicitly.</P>

<P>Level descriptions (e.g., <SPAN CLASS="idlevel">x</SPAN>=&quot;book&quot;, <SPAN CLASS="idlevel">y</SPAN>=&quot;chapter&quot;) in the
ID table are handled in a similar fashion. The full
description is always given for the author level. the work
level and for the lower levels of the first work. Lower level
descriptions for subsequent works may be omitted if
unnecessary. Thus, if thirty consecutive works are cited by
Book/line, the table need only give this information for the
first instance only.</P>

<A NAME="Coding"></A>
<H3>Coding</H3>

<P>On PHI CD R0Ms, ASCII information in the citations is
treated literalty and the Beta code conventions used in text
data are not applicable. Beta code conventions <B>are</B> used to
ASCII text in descriptor ids (those with level codes 96, 97,
98, ..., 122) and in the level descriptions.</P>

<P>[page 10]</P>

<A NAME="ID_Table_Files"></A>
<H2>ID Table Files</H2>
<A NAME="Description"></A>
<H3>Description</H3>
<P>For each text file, the corresponding ID table file
provides a detailed account of the identity and location of
the authors and works for that file, the location of all major
sections within the works, and a complete listing of the
ending citation for each text block within a section. In the
case of documents, information is given to the document (<SPAN CLASS="idlevel">n</SPAN>)
level only for the end of each text block and information
about lower levels is not included. If the document id is the
same at the end of consecutive blocks, the first block is
marked with the document id: and the later ones have the new
block code without any additional information.</P>

<P>For example, the ID table for file TLG00l2.TXT would tell
us that the first author is named &quot;Homer&quot; and that the author
is cited &quot;0012&quot; that the first work is named &quot;Iliad&quot; and is
cited &quot;001&quot; and that the first major section of this work is
is Book 1. The block location for each of these is given, and
the section data is followed by a list of the ending citations
for each block in Book 1. The data for Book l will be followed
by that for Book 2, and so forth until the second work is
encountered.</P>

<P>Note that each subdivision is nested, that is, the text
for an author is divided into one or more works, the text for
a work is divided into one or more sectional and the text for
a section is divided into one or more blocks. A block may
contain parts of two or more sections or works; work and
section boundaries do not have to coincide with block
boundaries. The works and sections are presented in the ID
Table file in the same order as they are found in the text;
they are not sorted.</P>

<P>Because an editor will at times reorder a text but leave
the traditional citation intact, the ID table makes provision
for out-of-sequence lines. If an editor places a line numbered
912 between lines 310 and 311, this will usually produce an
exception field. An exception field lists the beginning and
ending citation for lines which do not fall in the expected
block. Note that if an editor positions line 314 between lines
310 and 311, this will not usually produce an exception. The
reason for this is that line 314 is very likely in the
expected block, despite the fact that it is out of order
within the block. Thus. to find line 912 in the example above,
you would locate the block in the usual fashion. Immediately
before the block which contains, say, lines 885-940, the
exception would be listed along with the true block location
for the line.</P>

<P>[page 11]</P>

<A NAME="Format"></A>
<H3>Format</H3>
<P>Each entry in the ID table is introduced by a type code
byte from zero to thirty-one (decimal). Each type of entry has
its own form and function. The entry may introduce a major
section, provide descriptive information for a section, or
give the ID ranges for a section or block. The form of the
entries is detailed below. Note that there is no length field
for entries which contain ID data. Since the ID data is always
the last field in the entry, and since ID bytes always have
the sign bit set the end of the entry can be found by reading
the ID bytes until a byte is encountered with the sign bit
clear.</P>

identifier (<SPAN CLASS="idlevel">a..b</SPAN>=0..l) and a l-byte length. The length
pertains to the description only and does not include the
type type, type identifier, or length byte. The description 
is usually the author or work name. Given at the
author or work level, as appropriate. These fields
typically indicate the full name of the author and of the
works by that author; they should not be confused with
the abbreviated forms in the <SPAN CLASS="idlevel">d</SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="idlevel">c</SPAN> fields in the actual
citations in the texts.</TD>

field identifier. For documents, the <SPAN CLASS="idlevel">n</SPAN>-level identifier
= 0, and no other levels are described. For <SPAN CLASS="idlevel">v..z</SPAN> levels,
the identifier is 4..0. The identifier is followed by a
l-byte length. The length pertains to the description
only and does not include the type type, type identifier,
or length byte. Given at the work level. These indicated
e.g., that the <SPAN CLASS="idlevel">y</SPAN> level refers to a book of the <U>Aeneid</U>

<H4>Abbreviated ID Fields</H4>

<P>In ID files, the full ID is given for each author ID
(level <SPAN CLASS="idlevel">a</SPAN> only), each work ID (level <SPAN CLASS="idlevel">a</SPAN> only) and each new
section (levels <SPAN CLASS="idlevel">v..z</SPAN>). In text files the full ID (al1 levels)
is given at the beginning of each 8K block. Other ID fields
usually contain only enough information to show how the
current ID field differs from the last. Thus most lines in a
text require only the code for &quot;increment the <SPAN CLASS="idlevel">z</SPAN>-level&quot; (binary
1000 0000). When the higher levels do not change, they need
not be cited. When a higher level does change, all lower
levels are implicitly set to binary 1. This often obviates the
need to cite the lower levels explicitly. Thus, to cite line 1
of chapter 2 in a work, the required citation would be
&quot;increment the <SPAN CLASS="idlevel">y</SPAN>-level&quot; (binary 1001 0000) since the <SPAN CLASS="idlevel">y</SPAN>-level
was previously set for Chapter l and the <SPAN CLASS="idlevel">z</SPAN>-level is set to 1

[page 13]

implicitly. Note that when the author, work or or document
changes, all lower levels are set to null.</P>

<P>Descriptions in the ID table are handled in a similar
fashion. The full description is always given for the author
level, the work level, and for the lower levels of the first
work. Lower level descriptions for subsequent works are given
only as needed. Thus, if thirty consecutive works are cited by
Book/line, the table will give this information for the first
instance only.</P>
